# Real-Time File Editing Feature

## Overview
This feature enables real-time collaborative file editing with multiple users working on the same file simultaneously. Users can see each other's cursors, edits in real-time, and collaborate seamlessly.

## Features

### üöÄ Core Functionality
- **Real-time collaborative editing** - Multiple users can edit files simultaneously
- **Live cursor tracking** - See where other users are typing in real-time
- **Version control** - Automatic conflict resolution and version management
- **Auto-save** - Files are automatically saved every 30 seconds
- **Manual save** - Users can manually save with Ctrl+S
- **File type support** - Supports multiple file types (JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, JSON, etc.)

### üë• Collaboration Features
- **Collaborator list** - See who's currently editing the file
- **Color-coded cursors** - Each user gets a unique color for their cursor

- Optionally add initial content
- Click "Create File"

### 3. Edit Files Collaboratively
- Click on any file to open it in the editor
- Start typing - changes are shared in real-time
- See other users' cursors and edits

- See active collaborators
- Delete files (if you're the creator)

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Components
- **File Model** (`backend/models/File.js`) - MongoDB schema for files
- **File Controller** (`backend/controllers/fileController.js`) - API endpoints
- **File Routes** (`backend/routes/fileRoutes.js`) - Express routes
- **Socket Events** (`backend/socket.js`) - Real-time communication

### Frontend Components
- **FileManager** (`frontend/src/components/FileManager.jsx`) - File browser interface
- **FileEditor** (`frontend/src/components/FileEditor.jsx`) - Collaborative editor
- **FileCollaboration** (`frontend/src/components/FileCollaboration.jsx`) - Main wrapper component

### Real-time Events
- `joinFile` - User joins file editing session
- `fileEdit` - Real-time content updates
- `cursorMove` - Cursor position updates
- `saveFile` - File save operations
- `userJoinedFile` / `userLeftFile` - Presence updates

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/files/room/:room` - Get files for a room
- `GET /api/files/:fileId` - Get specific file
- `POST /api/files` - Create new file
- `PUT /api/files/:fileId` - Update file content
- `DELETE /api/files/:fileId` - Delete file
- `POST /api/files/:fileId/collaborators` - Add collaborator
- `DELETE /api/files/:fileId/collaborators/:userId` - Remove collaborator

## File Types Supported
- Text files
- JavaScript (.js)
- Python (.py)
- HTML (.html)
- CSS (.css)
- JSON (.json)
- XML (.xml)
- YAML (.yaml)
- SQL (.sql)
- Markdown (.md)

## Security Features
- **Authentication required** - All file operations require valid JWT token
- **Authorization** - Only file creators can delete files
- **Room-based access** - Files are scoped to specific chat rooms
- **Version conflicts** - Prevents data loss with automatic conflict detection

## Performance Optimizations
- **Debounced updates** - Real-time edits are debounced to 500ms
- **Efficient cursors** - Cursor positions are optimized for performance
- **Auto-save intervals** - Prevents excessive save operations
- **Connection management** - Proper cleanup of socket connections

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with WebSocket support
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers
